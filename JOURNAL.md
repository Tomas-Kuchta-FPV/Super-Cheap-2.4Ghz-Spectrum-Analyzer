## 10/30/2025 - Decided on design.  

Decided on design constraints and Made a BOM.
I think that a 2.8 Inch should be plenty big. On the Cheap Osciloscopes the screen is 2.4 inch.

Tested the ESP-erimentation code.

And launched an issue to the repo that they should add a License. Even though I'll not use their work as is.

Little preview:
